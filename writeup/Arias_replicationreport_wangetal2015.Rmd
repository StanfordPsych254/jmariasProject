### Introduction

The study presented here attempts to replicate the findings of Study 2 in Wang et al. (2015), which demonstrated that the relationship between math anxiety and math performance follows an inverted-U pattern among college undergraduate students with higher intrinsic math motivation, whereas this same relationship is linearly negative among students with lower intrinsic math motivation. The current study attempts to replicate this finding using Amazon Mechanical Turk participants. 



### Method

#### Power Analysis

Original test: F-test: multiple, fixed-effects regression with 9 total predictors and one observed predictor for change in R-squared. 

Original effect size: 

  - Of total R-squared: **.16**
  - Of change in R-squared for variable of interest (interaction of math anxiety squared and math motivation): **.02**.

Power analysis for original study: For an effect size of .02 from the above F-test with 219 participants and an alpha of .05, the estimated power achieved of the original is: **55%**. 

 - Sample Size needed to achieve 80% power (assuming same effect size): **395**.
 - Sample Size needed to achieve 90% power (assuming same effect size): **528**.
 - Sample Size needed to achieve 95% power (assuming same effect size): **652**.
 
#### Planned Sample
To achieve 80% power, the planned sample will be **415** adult participants recruited from Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform. This total number is calculated as 5% above the 395 participants needed, in order to satisfy the power calculation after potentially removing participants due to missing data or other exclusion criteria. 

Study 2 of Wang et al. (2015) initially collected data from 237 undergraduate students, 56% female, mean age = 19.53 years old (*SD* = 2.01, range = 18 - 39), for their participant sample (219 participants were kept for the full analyses). 
	

#### Materials
  
Please see below for quoted descriptions of the materials used in the original study, which were adapted for the present replication to be used by an online MTurk population: 

> Participants self-reported math anxiety using the brief version of the Mathematics Anxiety Rating Scale (MARS-B; Suinn & Winston, 2003). The 30-item MARS-B is widely used to measure math anxiety in adults. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = not at all nervous, 5 = very very nervous). The MARS-B has excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = .94). 

> The trait subscale from the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger, 1983) was used to measure participants' general anxiety. This subscale consists of 20 items that are rated on a 4-point Likert-type scale (1 = almost never, 4 = almost always). This scale has excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = .94). 

> Participants self-reported their math motivation using the same three items from the scale used in Study 1 (M. M. Chiu and Zeng, 2008). The Cronbach's alpha for this scale is .82, which indicates good internal consistency. 

> The problem-verification task (Rinne & Mazzocco, 2014) was used to measure participants' math calculation fluency. Because the 64 easy items were far too easy for undergraduate students (mean accuracy = .93, SD = .06), we chose to focus on the 24 hard items (e.g., double-digit arithmetic, uncommon- denominator fraction, and solutions close to the correct answer). The hard items had wider performance variability (mean accuracy = .85, SD = .13) and were therefore a more proper measure of individual differences in calculation fluency in college students. On a laptop, participants were shown a series of two-operand arithmetic problems involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and equivalency of fractions. For each arithmetic problem, a solution was shown that was correct or incorrect, and participants were asked to answer "right," "wrong," or "don't know" as quickly as possible without calculating. Each item was presented for a maximum of 10 s. If no response was given within that time, the program proceeded to the next item. Reaction time (in seconds) was defined as the time between stimulus onset and response. For the current analyses, an efficiency score was calculated by dividing the percentage of total correct responses by the mean reaction time across all items.


### Procedure


#### Analysis Plan

Please see below for quoted descriptions of the relevant elements of the analysis plan from the original study, which were also conducted by the current replication. See below for differences of note between original and replication in the materials and procedure. 


>	Hierarchical regression analysis was used to examine whether the quadratic relation between math anxiety and math cognition was further moderated by math motivation. Specifically, performance on the problem- verification task was predicted in four steps. In Step 1, covariates including age, sex, and linear and quadratic terms of general anxiety were entered. The linear term of math motivation and math anxiety was entered in Step 2. In Step 3, we entered the quadratic term of math anxiety and the interaction between math anxiety and math motivation. Finally, we entered the moderated quadratic interaction term between math anxiety and math motivation in Step 4. Math anxiety, math motivation, and general anxiety were standardized and centered prior to analyses in order to compute the interaction and higher-order terms. The outcome variable was also standardized to maintain consistency across the two studies.
 

>  To further examine the moderated quadratic effects, we conducted post hoc analyses on the predictive effects of math anxiety at different levels of math anxiety and math motivation using the same procedures as in Study 1. We recentered math motivation at low (i.e., 1 SD below the mean) and high (i.e., 1 SD above the mean) levels to examine the relations between math anxiety and math performance across a wide range of math anxiety (3 SD, 2 SD, and 1 SD above and below the mean as well as at the mean) at these two different levels of math motivation (Aiken & West, 1991). At low levels of math motivation, math anxiety was modestly negatively associated with task performance across all levels of math anxiety. At high levels of math motivation, there was an inverted-U curvilinear relation between math anxiety and math performance (see Figure 3, below with replication model Figure).
	


### *Replication differences from Original Study*

#### Differences in Materials/Procedure

 - The three surveys and the measure of math performance (the Problem-Verification Task), were presented to participants as a webpage, direct from the MTurk interface, rather than as a Qualtrics survey, as in the original study (Study 2 of Wang et al., 2015).
 - In the current replication, each survey question had to be answered in order to continue to the next question, whereas in the original study, the survey questions prompted the participant to answer if no answer was given but allowed participant to continue without answering if they selected to continue multiple times. 

#### Differences in Analysis Plan
 - No differences in the analysis plans between the original and replication are anticipated. 
 - We also include a correlation table of the relevant variables as as done in the original, although this was not explicitly specified in their analysis plan.

## Key Model Replication Table

#### Summary table for replication of model. Model of note is Model 4, in which interaction between squared term of math anxiety and term for math motivation are included as predictors. 

#### If Model 4 below demonstrates a significant increase to the predictive quality of the model by including the interaction term of anxiety^2 and motivation, then the findings from the MTurk sample will have replicated the findings from the original Wang et al. 2015 undergraduate sample. 

#### This interaction term in Model 4 for the replication was not significant, thus the findings of Wang et al. (2015) did not replicate for this sample. Note, however, that the simple main effect of linear *math anxiety* is significantly predictive across models. See the Discussion section at the end of this report for a full discussion on these findings. 

```{r Summary table of model output}

mtable1234 <- mtable('Model 1' = mathperflm1,
            'Model 2' = mathperflm2,
            'Model 3' = mathperflm3,
            'Model 4' = mathperflm4,

#### Exploratory analyses

- In addition to replicating the analyses conducted by the original study, this replication also intended to discern if any differences existed in the MTurk sample on math performance based on other potentially relevant predictors. Namely:
    - Level of education
    - Whether participant was currently a student
    - Number of school-aged (5 - 18 yrs) children
    - Self-described frequency with which participant "helped child with math homework"
    - Amount of time being a parent (age of oldest child) 
    
- These exploratory analyses on effect of education level, current student status, whether or not participant has school-aged children, and frequency with which they help children with math homework on math performance will be conducted both independent of and in conjunction with math anxiety and math motivation. See below for planned analyses and plots of data.

### (Post Data Collection) Methods Addendum

#### Actual Sample

The collected sample size was 415 MTurk participants. From this sample, 12 participants were excluded from the analyses due to unresolvable corruptions in the data files, and 6 were excluded due to random answers or non-compliance (see "Excluding Outliers" section, above). The total sample size used for analyses was thus *397* participants, which satisfies the participant goal for achieving 80% power. 


#### Differences from pre-data collection methods plan

No operational changes were made from the pre-data collection methods plan. Some adjustments were made to the method by which the ggplot of the predicted models was created, but the model itself was the same as that outlined in the data plan. 

### Results

Below is a quoted excerpt from the original text (emphasis added), describing the key results obtained from the hierarchical linear models conducted on the data. Note that after controlling for their covariates of interest, and linear and two-way interaction effects, the quadratic interaction between math anxiety and math motivation added predictive effects on math performance. 

>  Overall, age and sex both negatively predicted task performance, which indicates that younger and male participants performed better on average than older and female participants, with a larger effect size for sex than for age. General anxiety did not predict math performance. Math anxiety negatively predicted math performance after we controlled for the effects of the covariates. Finally, after controlling for all the linear and two-way interaction effects, we found that *the moderated quadratic interaction between math anxiety and math motivation was statistically significant and added incremental predictive effects on math performance*.

The current study did not replicate the key finding of Wang et al. (2015), in that the interaction term of *math anxiety squared* and *math motivation* did not add significant predictive value to the model of math performance. In the original study, this interaction coefficient had a value of *-.10* (standardized units) and was significant at *p*<.05. In the current replication, this same coefficient had a value of *0.002* and a p-value of *0.923*. 

Of note, the linear main effect term for math anxiety was significantly predictive, and was so across all relevant tested models. In Model 4, math anxiety had a coefficient of *-0.140* and was significant at *p*=.00039. This relationship can be seen by the fact that the plotted models all show a consistent linear decrease in math performance as math anxiety levels among individuals became higher. 

This main effect of math anxiety was also the only term that remained significantly predictive when all demographic covariates were included in the regression models. In Model 4 of the exploratory analyses, math anxiety had a coefficient of *-0.141* and was significant at *p*=.00042.


### Discussion

#### Summary of Replication Attempt

As mentioned above, the primary result from the confirmatory analysis did not replicate the significant findings of Wang et al. (2015). A significant main effect of math anxiety on math performance was found, in that there is a negative predictive relationship between math anxiety and math performance. But the finding that math anxiety has different effects on math performance depending on math motivation was not found. As such, though a stable pattern between math anxiety and math performance was found, because no main effects of math motivation or interactions between motivation or anxiety were found, the current study failed to replicate original results. 

#### Commentary

Exploratory analyses attempted to discern if the relationship between math anxiety and math performance was differentially affected by relevant demographic characteristics of the MTurk population. None of the predictors included in a number of models significantly altered or improved the model of the relationship between anxiety and performance. Math anxiety remained significantly negatively predictive of math performance across a number of demographic characteristics, including the education level of participants, whether or not the participant was currently a student, and whether the participant had children and helped their children with math homework. 

One of the key differences between the original study and this replication attempt is that the original used undergraduate students and this replication used MTurk participants, only some of whom were currently in any form of schooling. Given the lack of interaction between student status and the relationship between math anxiety and performance, however, this difference does not seem as impactful on a failure to replicate as potentially expected. The failure to replicate the findings from the original study may be more likely to the particularly small effect size of the interaction effect initially found (change in R-squared of *.02*). Even with increasing the sample size from 219 to 397, no significant effect of an interaction between anxiety and motivation was found. Despite a successful replication of the full interactive terms, the significant main effect of math anxiety on performance suggests the influence anxiety can have on such tasks, and highlights the importance of further research on math anxiety and the different ways its effects on performance can be mitigated.
