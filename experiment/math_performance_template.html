<!-- ## Introduction -->
<!-- This example experiment is a categorization task. On every trial, the subject sees a number and has to press a key depending on whether the number is even or odd. There are two between-subjects independent variables: which keys get pressed (either P for even and Q for odd or vice versa) and the trial order (subjects see one of two fixed orders). There are two dependent variables: accuracy and reaction time. -->

<!-- This example assumes that you already know the basics of HTML, JavaScript (JS), and CSS. If not, [the Codecademy tutorials](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript) are a useful starting point. -->

<!-- ## Code -->
<html>
<head>
	<title>Math performance component</title>
	<!-- Include the [jQuery library](http://jquery.com/), which helps you manipulate HTML elements from JS. -->
	<script src="jquery-1.11.2.min.js"></script>

	<!-- Include my library, [mmturkey][mmturkey], which manages submitting data to Mechanical Turk. This defines a global object, <code>turk</code>, and attaches five properties to it, <code>hitId</code>, <code>assignmentId</code>, <code>workerId</code>, <code>previewMode</code>, and <code>turkSubmitTo</code>. It also provides a single method, <code>submit(data)</code>, which you use to submit data to Turk. If no submission URL has been provided (because, e.g. you're testing your code outside of the Turk environment), <code>submit</code> displays what would have been submitted (without, obviously, any Turk-specific variables like <code>workerId</code> and <code>assignmentId</code>).  -->

	<!-- Include the cascading style sheet (CSS), which lets us separate style from content. This stylesheet is important because it defines the notion of a **slide** and also makes things look nicer, which subjects appreciate. It's worth looking at the [source code](style.html). -->
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />

	<p class="block-text">In the next section, you will be doing some fast math activities. You will be shown a series of math problems, one at a time. You won't need to figure out the answers to the problems, because the answers will already be there. Your job is to decide whether the answer given to each problem is right or wrong.
		<!-- Tell the subject which keys to press. We need to set these values dynamically; I use <code>{{}}</code> to indicate template locations in HTML that will be modified by JavaScript. -->
	<p class="block-text">
	Press <span id="correct-key">{{}}</span> if you think the given answer is RIGHT and
	<span id="incorrect-key">{{}}</span> if you think the given answer is WRONG.
<p  class="block-text">
1. Please do NOT use pencil and paper or any type of calculator.
<p  class="block-text">
2. Remember, it's a FAST math judgement task. So please make your judgement for each problem as quickly and accurately as possible.
<p  class="block-text">
3. You will be given a maximum of 10 SECONDS for each problem. The program will automatically proceed to the next problem after 10 seconds, with or without your answer. You will be shown a timer to remind you of the time remaining for each problem.
<p  class="block-text">
4. Press the Start button to start your practice trials. You will have 4 practice trials to get you warmed up.

<!-- Include the <a href="experiment.html">JavaScript file for the experiment</a>. As written, that script immediately executes commands, so we include it here at the end of the HTML file to ensure that resources referenced by the script actually exist. For instance, one of the immediately executed commands is <code>showSlide("instructions")</code>. If we loaded experiment.js, say, in the <code>head</code> section, <code>showSlide("instructions")</code> would fail because the <code>instructions</code> slide doesn't exist yet. It is possible to load the script in <code>head</code> but you have to ensure that any immediately executed commands, if they rely on potentially uninitialized HTML elements, are _delayed_ until the page is ready, using either [window.onload][onload] or jQuery's more robust [$(document).ready()][domReady]  -->
