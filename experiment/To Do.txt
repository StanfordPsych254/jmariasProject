*Only one of the 3 likert surveys correctly displays "please choose an option" when nothing is selected
	-Find and change the naming error in the javascript that is generating this
	

*Fractions for perfromance task not displaying correctly
	-Find unicode or code to display fractions
	-OR Turn fractions (and all others) into images and display that way


*Add 10-second automatic timeout for the performance task, along with countdown timer
	-Write script for automatic countdown to next task slide (10 seconds)
	-Create countdown button showing 10 seconds with each new task slide


*Add "correct" "incorrect" (and maybe "don't know"?) buttons to performance task, rather than keyboard clicks
	-add buttons	
	-remove keyboard "p" "q" click options
	-make buttons move forward to the next slide, and register response
	-Make sure code registers response (both selection and reaction time) along with other data




*Merge the 3 likert surveys (mathmotivationsurveys) with the performance task (math_performance_template)
	-Make sure performance task is always after 3 (random-order) surveys
	-**Should I have a "header" slide between each survey? i.e., "This next set of questions relates to your feelings about math. Please respond with...")
		-Or should I just leave it as it is, with one scale going right into the next (this is easier...b/c it's done, but not ideal)
	-Make font of question larger for all surveys


*Re-check original study for the following:
	-Click interface: how many buttons / which options did they provide? 
	-What order and randomization were the surveys and task (i.e., double-check that task was always last)
	-Find how they "introduced" each likert scale (i.e. "please respond with how often you do the following..."?)
