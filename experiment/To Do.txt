*Only one of the 3 likert surveys correctly displays "please choose an option" when nothing is selected

	-Find and change the naming error that leads to this
	-RDH: this ended up being kind of complicated; check out the changes I committed!

*Fractions for performance task not displaying correctly
	-Find unicode or code to display fractions
	      * RDH: Looks like you can do this using subscript, superscript, and a unicode fraction slash thing (http://www.willmaster.com/library/web-content-prep/how-to-make-fractions-on-a-web-page.php)
	-OR Turn fractions (and all others) into images and display that way

*RDH: End trial after 10 seconds
	-Put the call to "next()" in a "setTimeout()" function (http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_settimeout.asp)


*Add 10-second automatic timeout for the performance task, along with countdown timer
	-Write script for automatic countdown to next task slide (10 seconds)
	-Create countdown button showing 10 seconds with each new task slide


*Add "correct" "incorrect" (and maybe "don't know"?) buttons to performance task, rather than keyboard clicks
	-add buttons
	-remove keyboard "p" "q" click options
	-make buttons move forward to the next slide, and register response
	-Make sure code registers response (both selection and reaction time) along with other data




	*Merge the 3 likert surveys (mathmotivationsurveys) with the performance task (math_performance_template)
		-Make sure performance task is always after 3 (random-order) surveys
	-**Should I have a "header" slide between each survey? i.e., "This next set of questions relates to your feelings about math. Please respond with...")
		-Or should I just leave it as it is, with one scale going right into the next (this is easier...b/c it's done, but not ideal)
	-Make font of question larger for all surveys


*RDH: Show timer countdown
      - Store "startTime" at the beginning of a trial using "var startTime = new Date().getTime();"
      - Make a little function called "displayTime" that writes 10 minus the difference between the current time and startTime to a <p> </p> element in your html
        ** See http://www.electrictoolbox.com/get-milliseconds-javascript-measure-time/
      - Put a call to "displayTime" in the "setInterval()" function to update the time every second... (http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_setinterval.asp)


*Re-check original study for the following:
	-Click interface: how many buttons / which options did they provide?
	-What order and randomization were the surveys and task (i.e., double-check that task was always last)
	-Find how they "introduced" each likert scale (i.e. "please respond with how often you do the following..."?)
