*Only one of the 3 likert surveys correctly displays "please choose an option" when nothing is selected
	-Find and change the naming error that leads to this
	-RDH: this ended up being kind of complicated; check out the changes I committed!

*Fractions for perfromance task not displaying correctly
	-Find unicode or code to display fractions
	      * RDH: Looks like you can do this using subscript, superscript, and a unicode fraction slash thing (http://www.willmaster.com/library/web-content-prep/how-to-make-fractions-on-a-web-page.php)
	-OR Turn fractions (and all others) into images and display that way

*RDH: End trial after 10 seconds
	-Put the call to "next()" in a "setTimeout()" function (http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_settimeout.asp)

*RDH: Show timer countdown
      - Store "startTime" at the beginning of a trial using "var startTime = new Date().getTime();"
      - Make a little function called "displayTime" that writes 10 minus the difference between the current time and startTime to a <p> </p> element in your html
        ** See http://www.electrictoolbox.com/get-milliseconds-javascript-measure-time/
      - Put a call to "displayTime" in the "setInterval()" function to update the time every second... (http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_setinterval.asp)

*Merge the 3 likert surveys (mathmotivationsurveys) with the performance task (math_performance_template)
	-Make sure performance task is always after 3 (random-order) surveys

*Re-check original study for the following:
	-Click interface: how many buttons / which options did they provide? 
	-What order and randomization were the surveys and task (i.e., double-check that task was always last)
